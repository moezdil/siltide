# Download the script and then run it, rather than piping it into sh. A
# pipeline reports the status of its LAST command, so a download that 404s
# hands sh an empty script: nothing runs, the line exits 0, and the machine
# has installed nothing while appearing to have succeeded. Two lines also
# mean the script can be read before it is run, which is the other half of
# the reason not to pipe it.
#
# Everything is inside main(), called on the last line: a script read from a
# broken connection is a syntax error that does nothing, rather than half a
# script that does half of this.
#
# POSIX sh, not bash: this has to work under dash on Debian and BusyBox ash
# on Alpine, which are /bin/sh on machines people actually run.

  --version <x.y.z>   install a given release instead of the latest

Without --dir it installs into /usr/local/bin when that is writable, and
